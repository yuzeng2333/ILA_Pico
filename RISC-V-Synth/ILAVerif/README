This directory contains four parts of proving the ISA equivalence.
BaseI is for the base instructions, not containing interrupt.
Completeness is the checking for instruction completeness.
Interrupt is only for interrupts
and LemmaCheck is for lemma.

These are supposed to be checked with JasperGold. The TCL script do.tcl
will load and run the checking, except for BaseI, where handle.py is used
to manage multiple run.
